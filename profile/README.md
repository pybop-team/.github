PyBOP (Python Battery Optimisation and Parameterisation) is a modular, open-source package for the parameterisation and optimisation of battery models, with a particular focus on classes built around PyBaMM models and structures. A few of the aims for PyBOP are:

- Parameter estimation of battery models (electrochemical or equivalent circuit) -- to be used for e.g. pack design purposes, BMS design, and aging data analysis.
- Design optimisation studies, e.g., layer thickness, number of layers, tab placement.
- A tertiary requirement for PyBOP might be model synthesis, i.e., generating (low order) models automatically from data or higher order, more complex models.
